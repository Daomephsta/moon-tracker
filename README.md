# moon-tracker
moon-tracker is a simple application for calculating the phases of moons on a given day of the lunar cycle.  
The names and cycle lengths of each moon are configurable in the config file.
It currently has a very crude (but useable) prompt-based terminal interface, which I intend to replace with
a GUI once Rust's GUI frameworks are mature enough.

The original version was written in Python, and never published to Github, this version has been rewritten in Rust as a learning exercise.
